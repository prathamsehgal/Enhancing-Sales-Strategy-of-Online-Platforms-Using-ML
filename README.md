This is a project which helps e-learning platforms to increase their sales . obtianed 92.37% score .
# Goals of the Case Study :

Build a model to lead more conversion rate and boost morale of the sales team.
## Project Summary
1. The project was focused on the real-life problem which is faced by various organisations that is finding the more interested user who is more likely to buy the product. This process is called predictive scoring in B2C market and we created an automated system to rank users according to their activity. This system will help sales team to spent more time on the interested user rather than wasting their time on less interested users. That will lead to more conversion rate (from 30% to 70%)- (as data set was artificially created and balanced).
2. The Dataset we used was available on Kaggle and has 9000 datapoints and 37 attributes.


## Benefits inferred from the project:
1. Increased Sales
2. Spending more time on leads that are more likely to convert.Hence increases moral for the sales team.
3. As more data is accumulated in the system,prediction quality will increase.

## Conclusion 
1. Sales is an important process of a company as it directly affect revenue of a company.By using classification model and tuning the huge amount of parameters we obtained the accuracy of 92.37%.
2. The analysis also showed that feature extraction and selection plays a crucial role in the accuracy of the models.
